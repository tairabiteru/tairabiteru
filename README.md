Hello, Iâ€™m @tairabiteru, a self-taught web and backend developer living in the beautiful state of Michigan!


My interests include:
- Software development, computer science, information systems, and server administration
- Natural sciences like chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and biology
- Electronics and electronic engineering, as well as embedded systems
- Music and music theory (I play the Ocarina and the Ukulele!)
- Michigan! I'm madly in love with my state, and I'm so thankful that I get to live in a place like this!

Languages:
English, Spanish, and a bit of Japanese......Oh! *Programming* languages!
If I had to pick a favorite language, I'd probably have to say Python. It's the one I'm by far the most comfortable in, and it's my first language of choice when it comes to new projects. I'm comfortable with a lot of languages though, and I play well with most high level languages. I *tolerate* C++, but I can't say I like it. I have a big soft-spot for Rust though. I also write some Javascript, but I'm by no means a master of the language. I also do HTML and CSS, but again, I'm no master. Finally, I've had exposure to C, Java, and PHP, but have never written anything grand in them.
